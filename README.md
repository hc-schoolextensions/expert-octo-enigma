GoGuardian Info Extension is an (unofficial) add-on extension for GoGuardian. GoGuardian Info Extension modifies the GoGuardian "Website Blocked" page by adding an icon in the corner of the page. When you click this icon, a box will appear with information about what was blocked and why it was blocked.
